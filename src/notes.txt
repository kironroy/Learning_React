Using React and **lifting state up** is more efficient than managing state with **standard JavaScript** 
for several reasons:

### 1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - In React, state lives in a **centralized parent component**, 
   ensuring that all child components update in sync.
   - Standard JavaScript often requires **manual event listeners** 
   and updates across multiple DOM elements, which can lead to inconsistencies.

### 2. **Automatic Re-Renders**
   - React **automatically updates the UI** when state changes, 
   ensuring components are always in sync.
   - Standard JavaScript requires **manually updating the DOM**, 
   which can be error-prone and inefficient.

### 3. **Component Reusability**
   - With React, components can **reuse logic** and be easily managed.
   - Standard JavaScript often relies on **duplicated code**, 
   making maintenance harder.

### 4. **Better Performance with Virtual DOM**
   - React uses the **Virtual DOM**, calculating minimal updates needed.
   - Standard JavaScript directly manipulates the **real DOM**, 
   which is **slower** and can cause performance issues.

### 5. **Simpler State Management**
   - React’s **state lifting** lets multiple components share data **without complex event handling**.
   - Standard JavaScript requires **global variables or event-based communication**, which can be messy.

In short, React streamlines UI updates **efficiently**, 
while standard JavaScript requires **more manual work**. Want to see a real-world example comparing both? 

Reacting to input with state 
With React, you won’t modify the UI from code directly. For example, you won’t write commands like “disable the button”, “enable the button”, “show the success message”, etc. 
Instead, you will describe the UI you want to see for the different visual states of your component (“initial state”, “typing state”, “success state”), 
and then trigger the state changes in response to user input. This is similar to how designers think about UI.

 Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements in your application. Let’s look at the component line by line to see what’s going on:


 As a next step, you want the Square component to “remember” that it got clicked, and fill it with an “X” mark. To “remember” things, components use state.

React provides a special function called useState that you can call from your component to let it “remember” things. Let’s store the current value of the Square in state, and change it when the Square is clicked.

Import useState at the top of the file. Remove the value prop from the Square component. Instead, add a new line at the start of the Square that calls useState. Have it return a state variable called value:


 function handleClick(i) {
    const nextSquares = squares.slice();
    nextSquares[i] = "✖️";
    setSquares(nextSquares);
  }

Why immutability is important 
Note how in handleClick, you call .slice() to create a copy of the squares array instead of modifying the existing array. To explain why, we need to discuss immutability and why immutability is important to learn.

There are generally two approaches to changing data. The first approach is to mutate the data by directly changing the data’s values. The second approach is to replace the data with a new copy which has the desired changes. Here is what it would look like if you mutated the squares array:

const squares = [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];
squares[0] = 'X';
// Now `squares` is ["X", null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];
